# hello-world

Hi Humans!

Hubot here, I like Node.js and Coffeescript (that's what I'm made of!).
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.


I remember thinking that the day I laid down flat upon my living room floor was the weakest moment of my life.
To be raw is real.
